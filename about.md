## :wave: My name is Saqib Nizam Shamsi. 

Hey! Tell me a little about yourself. Things like...

#### What do you do?

I am a part of the Machine Learning team at Whirlpool Corporation, currently working on Computer Vision. 

Previously, I was a Software Engineer at Aspiring Minds where I work on automata, a system to grade computer programs; auto-interview, a piece of software that judges a candidate's interview performance.

#### What interests you?

Over the last few years I've developed an interest in machine learning. I have participated in some challenges about which you can read on the blog. I'm interested in pursuing research in machine learning.

#### That's nice, but what are your interests outside of work?

Oh, That! :smile:

I love books, food and anime. 

Books. I always prefer hardbooks unless I'm travelling, during which I read on my Kindle. I read all genres but am inclined towards tragedies. On the top of my list are The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini and Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl.

Food. Indian cuisine. I prefer spicy over sweet. Dosas, Idlis, Kadhai Paneer, Dal Makhani, Malai Kofta, Samosas, Pani Puri... :yum: you name it! 

Anime. They have had a lasting impact on me. A lot of characters - Naruto Uzumaki, Itachi Uchiha, Akane Tsunemori, Lelouch vi Britannia, Kaori Miyazono, Hana, Roy Mustang, to name a few - have shaped my worldview and have taught me a lot. 

#### How can I get in touch?

You can drop me a [mail](mailto:shamsi.saqib@gmail.com) or can use any of the social media channels.

#### What if I want to send an ultra-secret message?

You can get my public key from [keybase](https://keybase.io/saqibns) and can use it to send an encrypted message to me.
