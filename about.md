## :wave: My name is Shubham Singh. 

Hey! Tell me a little about yourself. Things like...

#### What do you do?

I am a part of the Sports team at Skilrock Technologies, currently working on Lottery Management System as a backend Developer. 

#### What interests you?

Over the last few years I've developed an interest in problem-solving,optimization,machine learning. I have participated in some challenges about which you can read on the blog.

#### That's nice, but what are your interests outside of work?

Oh, That! :smile:

I love memes,programming,gaming. 

Books. I always prefer hardbooks unless I'm travelling, during which I read on my Kindle. I read all genres but am inclined towards tragedies. On the top of my list are The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini and Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl.

Food. Indian cuisine. I prefer spicy over sweet. Dosas, Idlis, Kadhai Paneer, Dal Makhani, Malai Kofta, Samosas, Pani Puri... :yum: you name it! 

Anime. They have had a lasting impact on me. A lot of characters - Naruto Uzumaki, Itachi Uchiha, Akane Tsunemori, Lelouch vi Britannia, Kaori Miyazono, Hana, Roy Mustang, to name a few - have shaped my worldview and have taught me a lot. 

#### How can I get in touch?

You can drop me a [mail](mailto:singhcse01@gmail.com) or can use any of the social media channels.
