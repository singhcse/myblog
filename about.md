## :wave: My name is Shubham Singh. 

Hey! Tell me a little about yourself. Things like...

#### What do you do?

I am a part of the Sports team at Skilrock Technologies, currently working on Lottery Management System as a backend Developer. Currently I am working on products RMS(Retail management System),SBS(Sports betting System). My neurons are still learning .

#### What interests you?

Over the last few years I've developed an interest in problem-solving,optimization,machine learning. I have participated in some challenges about which you can read on the blog.Travelling excits me alot.

#### That's nice, but what are your interests outside of work?

Oh, That! :smile:

I love memes :wink: gaming :video_game: travelling :mount_fuji:

Memes.  If you have good sense of humour you can get this. :satisfied:

Gaming. call-of-duty , nfs , crysis , pubg  you name it. :fire:
Sometimes I also watch game streaming on twitch,youtube (Shroud,Ninja,Dynamo,Mortal).

Travelling. I think our neurons wont learn new patterns until we train it with unseen data. so, Exploring is very important for us.

#### How can I get in touch?

You can drop me a [mail](mailto:singhcse01@gmail.com) or can use any of the social media channels.
